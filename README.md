# Harvey_FEMA-HCAD_merged
A dataset that combines FEMA modeled flood damage and Harris County Appraisal District property data &amp; code built on top of that dataset

FEMA <a href="https://data.femadata.com/NationalDisasters/HurricaneHarvey/Data/DepthGrid/FEMA/Riverine_Modeled_Preliminary_Observations/20170901_Harris_Riverine_v2.gdb.zip">data</a> came from a 2017-09-01 model of flood damage. It isn't actual flood damage and new models are being made daily. *This model is not the latest!*

HCAD <a href="http://pdata.hcad.org/download/index.html">data</a> (Houston County Appraisal District) is 2017 data. The merged dataset is limited to only properties flagged by FEMA. 

The merge file is called: Harvey_FEMA_HCAD_Damage.json.zip
